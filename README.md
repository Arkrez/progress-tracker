<h1>Project Tracker</h1>
<p>This app is a work in progress. Tech stack MERN and <a hreaf="https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/story/about-big-calendar--page>Big Calender</a>. The objective of this app is to make it easier to keep track of progress for hobbies, work, etc. I eventually want to add some type of version control option, but I will probably need to pay for a larger cloud database for that and this is just a practice project, so I will probably have to implement some type of rate limiting error message when requests exceed the free tier rate limit</p>
